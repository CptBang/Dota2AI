This is our first kind-of polished build of our Dota2 Bot.
It uses a state machine as a macro-action selector and uses hardcoded modules for microing.
This version beats all proprietary Valve bots.

Usage:
Copy 'bots' folder into Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\scripts\vscripts. Create a custom game and select "Local Dev Script" to run contents of 'bots' folder.
